Hi! I'm Larry Hao.
You can contact me via email hzy2210@gmail.com

I was a research intern at Tencent-IEG, where I worked on training models and developing intelligent agents to serve the ENTIRE GROUP.

Since my freshman year, I have been dedicated to research in large language models (LLMs). I began conducting independent research in 2024, and I have recently submitted papers to ICLR 2026 and ACL 2026.

ðŸ”­ My current research focuses on LLM-related areas, including reinforcement learning, reasoning, agents, and LLM-based applications.

ðŸŒ±I am actively exploring practical applications of LLMs.

ðŸ‘¯I am open to collaborations on LLM and ML&RL applications and related research.
