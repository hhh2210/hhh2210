## About Me

I'm a research intern at **Tencent** (Summer 2025 in IEG and spring 2026 in CSIG Code-Buddy)

My research focuses on **reinforcement learning**, **reasoning**, and **LLM-based applications**. 

I'm especially interested in bridging the gap between academic research and real-world use cases.

Always open to collaborations in LLM/ML/RL research or projects, feel free to reach out!
