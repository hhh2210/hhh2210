 Hi! I’m Larry Hao.  
  
 You can reach me at **hzy2210@gmail.com**.  
>  
> I’m a research intern at **Tencent IEG**, where I work on training large language models (mostly 32B) and developing intelligent agents for practical deployment.  
>  
> Since my freshman year, I’ve been deeply passionate about large language models (LLMs). In 2024 summer, I began conducting independent research, and I’ve recently submitted papers to **ICLR 2026**.  
>  
> 🔭 My research focuses on **RL**, reasoning, intelligent agents, and **LLM-based applications**.  
>  
> 🌱 I’m exploring ways to bridge LLM research and real-world use cases.  
>  
> 👯 I’m always open to collaborations in **LLM, ML, and RL research**—feel free to reach out!
