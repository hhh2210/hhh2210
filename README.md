## About Me

I'm a research intern at **Tencent IEG** (Summer 2025), where I train large language models (32B scale) and develop intelligent agents for practical deployment.

My research focuses on **reinforcement learning**, **reasoning**, and **LLM-based applications**. I'm especially interested in bridging the gap between academic research and real-world use cases.

Always open to collaborations in LLM/ML/RL research or projects, feel free to reach out!
